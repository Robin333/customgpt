HbA1c measurement and targets

Measurement
1.6.1 Measure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:
- 3 to 6 months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy
- 6 months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable. [2015]

1.6.2 Measure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation. [2015]

1.6.3 If HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type estimate trends in blood glucose control using one of the following:
- quality-controlled plasma glucose profiles
- total glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)
- fructosamine estimation. [2015]

1.6.4 Investigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or clinical biochemistry. [2015]

Targets
NICE has produced a patient decision aid on agreeing HbA1c targets which also covers factors to weigh up when discussing HbA1c targets with patients.

1.6.5 Discuss and agree an individual HbA1c target with adults with type 2 diabetes (see recommendations 1.6.6 to 1.6.10). Encourage them to reach their target and maintain it unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia) or their efforts to achieve their target impair their quality of life. Think about using the NICE patient decision aid on weighing up HbA1c targets to support these discussions. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.6 Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to reach and maintain their HbA1c target (see the sections on dietary advice and bariatric surgery and choosing drug treatments). For more information about supporting adherence see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. [2015]

1.6.7 For adults whose type 2 diabetes is managed either by lifestyle and diet, or lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). [2015]

1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:
- reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle, and adherence to drug treatment and
- support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and
- intensify drug treatment. [2015]

1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8 and NICE''s patient decision aid) on a case-by-case basis and in discussion with adults with type 2 diabetes, with particular consideration for people who are older or frailer if:
- they are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy
- tight blood glucose control would put them at high risk if they developed hypoglycaemia, for example, if they are at risk of falling, they have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, or they drive or operate machinery as part of their job
- intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, if they have significant comorbidities. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.10 If adults with type 2 diabetes reach an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss. [2015]

1.6.11 For guidance on HbA1c targets for women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. [2015]

1.6.12 Take the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)''s Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals into account when offering self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.13 Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:
- the person is on insulin or
- there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or
- the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or
- the person is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant (see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy). [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.14 Consider short-term self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes reviewing treatment as necessary:
- when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or
- to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.15 Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. [2015]

1.6.16 If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their capillary blood glucose levels carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment should include:
- the person''s self-monitoring skills
- the quality and frequency of testing
- checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take
- the impact on the person''s quality of life
- the continued benefit to the person
- the equipment used. [2015 amended 2022]


Continuous glucose monitoring

1.6.17 Offer intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM, commonly referred to as ''flash'') to adults with type 2 diabetes on multiple daily insulin injections if any of the following apply:
- they have recurrent hypoglycaemia or severe hypoglycaemia
- they have impaired hypoglycaemia awareness
- they have a condition or disability (including a learning disability or cognitive impairment) that means they cannot self-monitor their blood glucose by capillary blood glucose monitoring but could use an isCGM device (or have it scanned for them)
- they would otherwise be advised to self-measure at least 8 times a day. [2022]

1.6.18 Offer isCGM to adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes who would otherwise need help from a care worker or healthcare professional to monitor their blood glucose. [2022]

1.6.19 Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) as an alternative to isCGM for adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes if it is available for the same or lower cost. [2022]

1.6.20 CGM should be provided by a team with expertise in its use as part of supporting people to self-manage their diabetes. [2022]

1.6.21 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM that they will still need to take capillary blood glucose measurements (although they can do this less often). Explain that this is because:
- they will need to use capillary blood glucose measurements to check the accuracy of their CGM device
- they will need capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up (for example, when their blood glucose levels are changing quickly or if the device stops working).
Provide them with enough test strips to take capillary blood glucose measurements as needed. [2022]

1.6.22 If a person is offered rtCGM or isCGM but cannot or does not want to use any of these devices, offer capillary blood glucose monitoring. [2022]

1.6.23 Ensure CGM is part of the education provided to adults with type 2 diabetes who are using it (see the section on education). [2022]

1.6.24 Monitor and review the person''s use of CGM as part of reviewing their diabetes care plan (see the section on individualised care). [2022]

1.6.25 If there are concerns about the way a person is using the CGM device:
- ask if they are having problems using their device
- look at ways to address any problems and concerns to improve their use of the device, including further education and emotional and psychological support. [2022]

1.6.26 Commissioners, providers, and healthcare professionals should address inequalities in CGM access and uptake by:
- monitoring who is using CGM
- identifying groups who are eligible but who have a lower uptake
- making plans to engage with these groups to encourage them to consider CGM. [2022]');

1.6.10 If adults with type 2 diabetes reach an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss. [2015]

1.6.11 For guidance on HbA1c targets for women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. [2015]

1.6.12 Take the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)''s Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals into account when offering self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.13 Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:
- the person is on insulin or
- there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or
- the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or
- the person is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant (see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy). [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.14 Consider short-term self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes reviewing treatment as necessary:

- checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take
- the impact on the person''s quality of life
- the continued benefit to the person
- the equipment used. [2015 amended 2022]


Continuous glucose monitoring

1.6.17 Offer intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM, commonly referred to as ''flash'') to adults with type 2 diabetes on multiple daily insulin injections if any of the following apply:
- they have recurrent hypoglycaemia or severe hypoglycaemia
- they have impaired hypoglycaemia awareness
- they have a condition or disability (including a learning disability or cognitive impairment) that means they cannot self-monitor their blood glucose by capillary blood glucose monitoring but could use an isCGM device (or have it scanned for them)
- they would otherwise be advised to self-measure at least 8 times a day. [2022]

1.6.18 Offer isCGM to adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes who would otherwise need help from a care worker or healthcare professional to monitor their blood glucose. [2022]

1.6.19 Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) as an alternative to isCGM for adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes if it is available for the same or lower cost. [2022]

1.6.20 CGM should be provided by a team with expertise in its use as part of supporting people to self-manage their diabetes. [2022]

1.6.21 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM that they will still need to take capillary blood glucose measurements (although they can do this less often). Explain that this is because:
- they will need to use capillary blood glucose measurements to check the accuracy of their CGM device
- they will need capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up (for example, when their blood glucose levels are changing quickly or if the device stops working).
Provide them with enough test strips to take capillary blood glucose measurements as needed. [2022]

1.6.22 If a person is offered rtCGM or isCGM but cannot or does not want to use any of these devices, offer capillary blood glucose monitoring. [2022]

1.6.23 Ensure CGM is part of the education provided to adults with type 2 diabetes who are using it (see the section on education). [2022]

1.6.24 Monitor and review the person''s use of CGM as part of reviewing their diabetes care plan (see the section on individualised care). [2022]

1.6.25 If there are concerns about the way a person is using the CGM device:
- ask if they are having problems using their device
- look at ways to address any problems and concerns to improve their use of the device, including further education and emotional and psychological support. [2022]

1.6.26 Commissioners, providers, and healthcare professionals should address inequalities in CGM access and uptake by:
- monitoring who is using CGM
- identifying groups who are eligible but who have a lower uptake
- making plans to engage with these groups to encourage them to consider CGM. [2022]');

HbA1c measurement and targets

Measurement
1.6.1 Measure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:
- 3 to 6 months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy
- 6 months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable. [2015]

1.6.2 Measure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation. [2015]

1.6.3 If HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type estimate trends in blood glucose control using one of the following:
- quality-controlled plasma glucose profiles
- total glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)
- fructosamine estimation. [2015]

1.6.4 Investigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or clinical biochemistry. [2015]

Targets
NICE has produced a patient decision aid on agreeing HbA1c targets which also covers factors to weigh up when discussing HbA1c targets with patients.

1.6.5 Discuss and agree an individual HbA1c target with adults with type 2 diabetes (see recommendations 1.6.6 to 1.6.10). Encourage them to reach their target and maintain it unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia) or their efforts to achieve their target impair their quality of life. Think about using the NICE patient decision aid on weighing up HbA1c targets to support these discussions. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.6 Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to reach and maintain their HbA1c target (see the sections on dietary advice and bariatric surgery and choosing drug treatments). For more information about supporting adherence see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. [2015]

1.6.7 For adults whose type 2 diabetes is managed either by lifestyle and diet, or lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). [2015]

1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:
- reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle, and adherence to drug treatment and
- support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and
- intensify drug treatment. [2015]

1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8 and NICE''s patient decision aid) on a case-by-case basis and in discussion with adults with type 2 diabetes, with particular consideration for people who are older or frailer if:
- they are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy
- tight blood glucose control would put them at high risk if they developed hypoglycaemia, for example, if they are at risk of falling, they have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, or they drive or operate machinery as part of their job
- intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, if they have significant comorbidities. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.7 For adults whose type 2 diabetes is managed either by lifestyle and diet, or lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). [2015]

1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:
- reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle, and adherence to drug treatment and
- support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and
- intensify drug treatment. [2015]

1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8 and NICE''s patient decision aid) on a case-by-case basis and in discussion with adults with type 2 diabetes, with particular consideration for people who are older or frailer if:
- they are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy
- tight blood glucose control would put them at high risk if they developed hypoglycaemia, for example, if they are at risk of falling, they have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, or they drive or operate machinery as part of their job
- intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, if they have significant comorbidities. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.10 If adults with type 2 diabetes reach an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss. [2015]

1.6.11 For guidance on HbA1c targets for women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. [2015]

1.6.13 Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:
- the person is on insulin or
- there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or
- the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or
- the person is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant (see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy). [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.14 Consider short-term self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes reviewing treatment as necessary:
- when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or
- to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.15 Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. [2015]

1.6.16 If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their capillary blood glucose levels carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment should include:
- the person''s self-monitoring skills
- the quality and frequency of testing
- checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take
- the impact on the person''s quality of life
- the continued benefit to the person
- the equipment used. [2015 amended 2022]


Continuous glucose monitoring

1.6.17 Offer intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM, commonly referred to as ''flash'') to adults with type 2 diabetes on multiple daily insulin injections if any of the following apply:
- they have recurrent hypoglycaemia or severe hypoglycaemia
- they have impaired hypoglycaemia awareness
- they have a condition or disability (including a learning disability or cognitive impairment) that means they cannot self-monitor their blood glucose by capillary blood glucose monitoring but could use an isCGM device (or have it scanned for them)
- they would otherwise be advised to self-measure at least 8 times a day. [2022]

1.6.18 Offer isCGM to adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes who would otherwise need help from a care worker or healthcare professional to monitor their blood glucose. [2022]

1.6.19 Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) as an alternative to isCGM for adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes if it is available for the same or lower cost. [2022]

1.6.20 CGM should be provided by a team with expertise in its use as part of supporting people to self-manage their diabetes. [2022]

1.6.21 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM that they will still need to take capillary blood glucose measurements (although they can do this less often). Explain that this is because:
- they will need to use capillary blood glucose measurements to check the accuracy of their CGM device
- they will need capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up (for example, when their blood glucose levels are changing quickly or if the device stops working).
Provide them with enough test strips to take capillary blood glucose measurements as needed. [2022]

1.6.22 If a person is offered rtCGM or isCGM but cannot or does not want to use any of these devices, offer capillary blood glucose monitoring. [2022]

1.6.23 Ensure CGM is part of the education provided to adults with type 2 diabetes who are using it (see the section on education). [2022]

1.6.24 Monitor and review the person''s use of CGM as part of reviewing their diabetes care plan (see the section on individualised care). [2022]

1.6.25 If there are concerns about the way a person is using the CGM device:
- ask if they are having problems using their device
- look at ways to address any problems and concerns to improve their use of the device, including further education and emotional and psychological support. [2022]

1.6.26 Commissioners, providers, and healthcare professionals should address inequalities in CGM access and uptake by:
- monitoring who is using CGM
- identifying groups who are eligible but who have a lower uptake
- making plans to engage with these groups to encourage them to consider CGM. [2022]');

HbA1c measurement and targets

Measurement
1.6.1 Measure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:
- 3 to 6 months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy
- 6 months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable. [2015]

1.6.2 Measure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation. [2015]

1.6.3 If HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type estimate trends in blood glucose control using one of the following:
- quality-controlled plasma glucose profiles
- total glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)
- fructosamine estimation. [2015]

1.6.4 Investigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or clinical biochemistry. [2015]

Targets
NICE has produced a patient decision aid on agreeing HbA1c targets which also covers factors to weigh up when discussing HbA1c targets with patients.

1.6.5 Discuss and agree an individual HbA1c target with adults with type 2 diabetes (see recommendations 1.6.6 to 1.6.10). Encourage them to reach their target and maintain it unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia) or their efforts to achieve their target impair their quality of life. Think about using the NICE patient decision aid on weighing up HbA1c targets to support these discussions. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.6 Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to reach and maintain their HbA1c target (see the sections on dietary advice and bariatric surgery and choosing drug treatments).

1.6.13 Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:
- the person is on insulin or
- there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or
- the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or
- the person is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant (see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy). [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.14 Consider short-term self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes reviewing treatment as necessary:
- when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or
- to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. [2015 amended 2022]

1.6.15 Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. [2015]

1.6.16 If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their capillary blood glucose levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment should include:
- the person''s self-monitoring skills
- the quality and frequency of testing
- checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take
- the impact on the person''s quality of life
- the continued benefit to the person
- the equipment used. [2015 amended 2022]');
